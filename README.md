# base-data
some base data for analyzing, for example lists of repositories


# magento

we need a list of all repositories of magento 1 to use them as base to analyze how the acitivty changed since the release of M2

most important is the url, it can be a github, bitbucket, or a direct git url. All other fields are basicly optional.

a github_id(api related) is nice, but is not needed. We can later write a script to fetch them.

types is basicly a freetext field, most important are modules here, but the other stuff is also nice to have.

And as we are mostly interested in M1 stuff, we have an extra field for it, but M2 stuff is also welcome.


Already a big thank you for helping.
